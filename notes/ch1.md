**What is automated regression testing ?**
=> Automated regression testing is a technique for ensuring that
new software upgrades do not break the functioning of an existing
software application. In addition to being extremely time
efficient, automated regression tests provide a thorough and
in-depth explanation of the failed test that has to be fixed.

On using npm init and after inspecting the `package.json` file, I
found `"license": "ISC"` . What does that mean ?

ISC is short of (Internet Systems Consortium) .
It is as the MIT liscense .
It allows developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the
code with minimal restrictions.

The writer talked about setting the repository field or else npm
will complain every time we run a command . 
He also suggested setting `private` property to `true` . 

But in my case, the `package.json` doesn't have the `repository`
field, so I won't bother with it now .

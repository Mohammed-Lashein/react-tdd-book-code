This is the 1st time I know that html forms have `elements` property on them which allows us to access the elements within the form from either their `name` or `id` attributes . 

[I wrote a post about a data structure similar to that returned by `elements` property](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7306986122742501377?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD3bEekBlC1nsY33KuOk5ikw8548pMCHqPc) .  
[I also found some notes about it on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements)
